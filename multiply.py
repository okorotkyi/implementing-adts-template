# MODIFY ME TO IMPLEMENT YOUR SOLUTION
# TO PROBLEM 2: MULTIPLICATION TABLE
#
# NAME:         FIXME
# ASSIGNMENT:   Technical HW: Arrays & Maps

# Write a function called multiplication_table that
# takes a width, height, & scaling factor as parameters
# and returns a two-dimensional array multiplication
# table scaled by the scaling factor.
# You should not be using any functions other than range.
